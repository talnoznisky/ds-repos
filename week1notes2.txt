Reading Excel files

download
read (params: file, header, sep, rownames, nrows)
	reads to RAM
		tries read tabs as separators by default
	read.csv/read.csv2
		^ read commas and header by default

ex of downloaded excel file
if(!file.exists(data)){dir.create("data")}
fileurl <- xxxxxxxxxx
download.file(fileurl,destfile<-"./data/trafficdata.xlsx",method="curl")
downloaddate<-date()
library(xlsx)  ##this is your xlsx package
read.xlsx
or write.xlsx (to write it back out)

Also look into XLconnect for doing a lot of excel manipulation
	check out xlconnect vignette


Reading XML
library(XML)
programmatically extract using XMLsapply(xmlfile,xmlvalue)
there's also XPATH language for dealing with xml
totally need more understanding about xml extraction

Reading JSON
jsonlite package
ex:
library(jsonlite)
jsonData <- fromJSON(filelocation)
names(jsonData) ##output is a data frame with all of the names
names(jsonData$owner)

toJSON(iris, pretty=TRUE) ##formats with indentation

Datatables
data.table
- subsetting:
	uses expressions between curly brackets
- keys
	- assign columns for subsetting
	- also facilitates joins
